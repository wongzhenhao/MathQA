# Code for \[Your Paper Title Here]

This repository contains the code for our paper:
**"\[Paper Title]"**, accepted/presented at \[Conference/Journal Name, Year].

## Overview

We present the implementation for reproducing the results of our work. The pipeline consists of two main stages:

---

## 1. Data Preparation (via [DataFlow](https://github.com/OpenDCAI/DataFlow))

We use the DataFlow framework for dataset preparation. Please follow the steps below:

```bash
# Step 1: pip install OpenDataFlow enviroment
pip install open-dataflow

# Step 2: Prepare the data using the provided scripts
python mathfusion.py
```

Make sure the processed dataset follows the required format expected by our training pipeline.

## 2. Training (Coming Soon)

We will release the training scripts and configuration files shortly.
